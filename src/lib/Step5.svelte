                "I use Tailwind for design, ensuring my projects are both functional and visually appealing. For more dynamic elements, I work with keyframes and 3D scenes using Three.js. Tailwind, too has nice derivatives such as Daisy and Skeleton UI, for their respective frameworks. Non-library libraries such as ShadCN have also been nice to work with for their customizeability.  Finally, I've been deep diving into visual representation libraries like D3, as they throw a very professional touch onto DeFi applications.
