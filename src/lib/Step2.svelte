"In the world of Full-Stack development, I've had my hands on a few systems. Vue, Next Js, and Svelte have been some of my go-tos. Each has its own charm, and I've enjoyed the unique challenges they bring.  I started with learning Full-Stack by graduating
Generation USA with a Full-Stack Developer Certificate.  I also passed my W3 Javascricpt Developer Certificate and my Scrum Certificate.  This is what got me interested in making the web exereince more interactive in novel ways."
