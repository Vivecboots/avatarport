                "I'm well-versed with Fauna and have a keen interest in zero-knowledge protocols, especially Polygon ZK-EVM. Oasis has caught my attention, and I'm gearing up to leverage it for an upcoming privacy-centric project. While Akash and the Internet Computer have their own set of intriguing features, I'm particularly excited about utilizing Akash to enhance the decentralization of a DAO in the near future."
